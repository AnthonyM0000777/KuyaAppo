            android:text="An allergic reaction is an acquired, abnormal
inflammatory reaction to a substance (allergen) that
is usually mild to moderate in most people. Pollens,
medications, certain foods, insect stings and bites,
dust mites, pet dander, perfumes, and detergents may
cause an allergic reaction. Allergies are common in all
age groups and reactions to allergens range in severity
from mild to severe to a life- threatening allergic reaction
called anaphylaxis.\n\n Even though a person may previously
have experienced no reactions or only very mild reactions
to an alergen for many years, in some cases repeated
exposures (sensitization) may eventually lead to a more
severe reaction without warning. As you become more
sensitized to an allergen, even a mild exposure may at
some point trigger a potentially life-threatening reaction.\n\n
Alert!\n\n
Anyone who has known serious allergies
should wear a Medical Alert ID or tag and
carry an epinephrine autoinjector pen with
written instructions on how and when to use
it. You' Il need a doctor' s prescription for
the selfcare epinephrine injector and you
can call1-800-IDALERT to get a medic alert
bracelet.\n\n
Allergies occur when your body' s defensive system, the
immune system, comes into contact, by eating, touching,
breathing, or injecting, with something it interprets as a
foreign substance and a threat. Sometimes the immune
system works to protect your body but other times it has
difficulty distinguishing between the actual threats and
substances that are not a threat. Those hyper-reactive
systems tend to react with an inflammatory response
to substances that aren' tactually harmful, such as
certain foods. Allergic reactions can range from mild to
severe reactions requiring immediate medical attention.
Sometimes symptoms are localized and immediate, but
they can also be general (systemic) and delayed.\n\n
Signs and Symptoms\n\n
Most allergic reactions are mild, and although they are
normally not serious or life threatening, it' sa god idea
to advise your doctor of the condition if it is new or unique
to your medical history. The following are common
symptoms of mild allergic reactions:\n\n
• Itchy skin\n\n
• Itchy, watery eyes\n\n
• Itchy, runny nose with
clear nasal discharge\n\n
• Sneezing\n\n
• Rashes and hives\n\n
• Minor swelling
Mild Reactions\n\n
A localized itchy rash (contact dermatitis) can be
prevented by avoiding contact with the allergen. Wash off
any known allergens immediately with soap and water,
keep the area clean and dry, and if needed treat with
calamine lotion. For all allergy symptoms, check with
your family doctor to see whether prescription or OTC
allergy medication is advised, such as antihistamines,
decongestants, or a combination of both. Your doctor
may tell you to treat rashes with antihistamine cream or
1% hydrocortisone cream. As always, determining what
is causing the allergic reaction and avoiding it is the best
COurse of action.\n\n
Sinus Irrigation for Mild Allergies\n\n
Sinus irrigation is a method of rinsing out and irrigating
the inside of your nose and the sinuses to remove any
allergens. It also helps clear any areas of infection
that may be forming in your nasal passages, making
breathing easier, as well as moisturizing your sinuses.
It s necessary to use a salt concentration similar to that
of your body, or isotonic, to prevent nasal-tissue swelling
and damage to the tissues. You can buy commercial
products or you can make your own solution (2 teaspoon
salt, V2 teaspoon baking soda, and 1 pint warm watern) and
store it in the refriaerator for up to two weeks.\n\n
Use the following method of sinus irrigation for relief of
nasal congestion due to allergies:\n\n
1. Use a soft rubber-tip bulb syringe to irrigate the nose.\n\n
2. Stand over a sink or in the shower with head forward,
mouth open, and chin out.\n\n
3. Insert the tip of the bulb syringe filled with solution
in the nose, stop breathing, and squeeze the solution
into nose, being careful not to swallow. If you need to
swallow, stop and bend your head forward and allow
solution to run out of your nose.\n\n
4. Repeat on the other side, then blow your nose very
gently, closing off one side at a time and blowing the
mouth open.\n\n
If you are bothered with allergens in the air, irrigate your
sinuses twice daily at first and then every day to every
third day or after activities that involve being outside
among allergens. You may also use a pulsating system
according to the manufacturer
s instructions.\n\n
Fact\n\n
Never assume that because you or a family
member has received allergy shots, you are
completely protected. Families with known
allergies should be especially aware of all
emergency procedures, including the use of
Epinephrine Auto-Injectors and CPR.
Severe Allergic Reactions
Severe allergic reactions are less common, and can be
life threatening if not treated immediately. If a person is
exhibiting any of the symptoms below, take them to a
hospital emergency room, or call emergency number for
emergency transport immediately:
• Flushed face, neck, chest, arms, hands"/>
