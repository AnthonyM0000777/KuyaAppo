stop, take a few deep breaths, and perform a complete
360- degree sweep of the accident scene and your
surroundings. Remember, your safety is key, so be sure
to assess any safety issues before you proceed. Keep
yourself safe by following these steps:\n\n
1. Park your vehicle in a safe spot that s out of the way
of any other moving vehicles, being careful not to block
traffic.\n
2. Check for any visible fuel or potentially combustible
liquid on the ground, and make sure to parka safe
distance away if you find any.\n
3. Look for any downed power lines to avoid, put on
your emergency brake and your hazard lights, and call
emergency number.\n
4. Check for traffic and exit your vehicle.
Do not run across any busy traffic lanes; you will not be
able to help if you also become injured.\n\n
Approaching the Accident and Taking\n\n
Charge
Your next steps should be:\n\n
1. Bring the first-aid kit from your vehicle and quickly
but carefully approach the scene while scanning and
assessing here to help, is anyone hurt?\n
    2. Shout\n
    3. Ask the first person you see how many passengers he
    thinks are involved.\n
    4. If everyone visible appears unconscious or
    unresponsive, do a fast visual scan of the surrounding
    area for additional people that may have been ejected as
    you move around vehicles.\n
    5. If there are other adults with you or nearby, take
    charge and ask for help as you need it in the most assertive way you can, without raising panic in others.
    \n\nIt s vital that professional rescuers and medical
    teams be on the way, so if you have not been able to
    call emergency number, ask someone else to call or
    go for help. Use common sense if you need to leave
    the scene to summon help yourself. Note if there are
    unmoving persons in the vehicles. If a small fire or heavy
    smoke is coming from the front of a car, threatening any
    passengers inside, then remove the persons from danger
    (without endangering yourself) before going for help.
    Above all else, summoning help and enlisting help in all
    your actions is a top priority.\n\n
    Alert!\n\n
    It s important to note and be aware that
    people have a legal right to refuse medical
    are and that includes the right to refuse your
    help. Again, act appropriately for the situation,
    but remnember that no means no in a
    COurtrOom.\n\n
    Safety Measures at the Scene
    In order to remain safe you must stay at least fifteen
    yards away from any downed power lines and always
    assume that they are live. Power lines that are touching
    any objects may also charge that object, and you
    may receive a fatal shock just being too close. Stop
    immediately if you feel any tingling sensations, put your
    feet together, and hop or shuffle away from the area,
    being very careful not to touch anything.
    If a vehicle is on its side and is unstable, try to stabilize
    it, but only if it' s necessary for your safety and/or the
    safety of those injured. Instruct everyone in the area not
    to smoke. If you are able to reach inside safely, turn off
    ignition switches and apply emergency brakes. If hoods
    are accessible and there is no indication of fire, carefully
    open the hood and remove the battery cable if you can.
    Its very important that you never move an injured person unless you feel they will die if they are not moved.
    Always assume that an injured person has a neck injury
    and attempt to stabilize their head by placing one hand on
    each side of it so the head stays in line with the spine and
    doesn' tmove until help arrives.\n\n
    Essential\n\n
    When you are a first responder and EMS
    arrives, get out of their way but remain
    available to answer questions and render
    additional assistance if they ask for it.
    Because you were first on the scene, you may
    have lifesaving information to give EMS!\n\n
    Sharing the Calm\n\n
    One of the most important things you can do for an
    injured person is to reassure them and give them the
    impression that you are calm, even if you don' treally
    feel that way. A violent accident and its aftermath can
    be emotionally traumatic, but in the moment, you must
    try to compartmentalize and put away any sense of fear
    or horror in order to help injured people as best as you
    can. People have been known to survive injuries that
    everyone on the scene believed were fatal. It is possible
    that a critically injured person may either fight for life and
    survive, or give up hope and expire, based at least in part
    on what they believe you think of their situation, so act
    confidently.\n\n
    Your Personal Aftermath\n\n
    Responding to a major accident with serious, sometimes
    fatal, injuries may be emotionally traumatic, even though
    at the time it may have been exciting and adrenaline
    pumping. Many people, even professionals, experience
    a wide range of delayed emotional responses when the
    event is over. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
    is a condition that may develop after a terrifying ordeal
    involving physical harm."/>
