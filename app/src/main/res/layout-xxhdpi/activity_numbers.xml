emergency number (example: 911) if you are not sure
whether the medical condition or complaint is really an
emergency.\n\n
There are many conditions that require immediate
attention, and you should not wait before calling
emergency number. Instead of risking serious
consequences or death if you are not sure, it s wise to
call for help. The following are conditions that warrant
calling emergency number, although certainly not an
exhaustive list:\n\n
• Severe allergic reaction\n
• Chest pain or heart attack, shortness of breath
Severe asthma attack or respiratory arrest\n
• Loss of consciousness or responsiveness\n
• Confusion, dizziness and fainting, or seizures\n
• Drug overdose, poisoning, or chemical exposure\n
• Heat stroke\n
• Rectal bleeding, bloody diarrhea, bleeding with
weakness, or vonmiting blood\n
• Blurred speech, weakness, any signs of stroke\n
• Uncontrolled bleeding, including nosebleeds
Serious burns\n
• Broken bones accompanied by signs of shock or spinal
injury\n
• Suicidal behavior, self-harming or violent behavior\n\n
Alert!\n
If you have warning signs of a heart attack,
call emergency number immediately
-there is a very limited amount of time
before damage to the muscle of the heart
is permanent. Emergency medical services
(EMS) are trained to treat cardiac arrest
on scene and in transit, and you will be
treated faster at the hospital if you arrive by
ambulance.\n\n

The dispatcher s computer is likely to show your
location, unless you are on a cell phone or calling
from work or another location where the phones are
connected to a switchboard. Try to remain calm and
answer all questions quickly and as accurately as you
are able. The dispatcher will need all of the following
information.\n\n
• Nature of the emergency\n
• When emergency first occurred\n
• Exact location or address where help is needed\n
• Phone number that you are calling from\n
• Your name and who else is involved\n\n
Follow all instructions given by the emergency number
dispatcher and stay on the phone until the dispatcher
tells you to hang up, or for as long as it is safe to do so.
Stay calm, be clear, listen to the dispatcher carefully, and
answer as concisely as possible.\n\n
Essential\n
It' s the emergency number dispatcher' s
job to know how to ask the right questions.
Pay attention and answer all questions as best
you can. Don' t hang up until you are told to;
if you are on a cell phone you may have to
give your exact location and other information
as your location will not be visible to the
dispatcher.\n\n

Teach young children how to phone enmergency number
by using a toy phone or an old, nonworking cell phone.
Explain to them that emergencies include car accidents,
crimes like when someone is hurting another person or
breaking into the house, when someone in the family
is suddenly very sick (for example, having a hard time
speaking, breathing, or turns blue), if anyone collapses or
passes out, or if the house is on fire.\n\n
Fact\n
Most children over five years of age are
capable of understanding and learning how
and when to call emergency number. Instruct
children to call emergency number only for
real emergencies. Make sure they understand
that the police and firefighters will come when
they call emergency number."/>
