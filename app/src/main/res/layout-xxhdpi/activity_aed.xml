series of assessments and interventions, and carcdiac
arrest is not just one problem, so the steps of CPR will
vary depending on the type or cause of the arrest. For
the purposes of this book, only lay-rescuer techniques
and methods will be reviewed. It
S worthy to note that
lay rescuers are no longer taught to check for pulse or
signs of circulation or taught to provide rescue breathing
without chest compressions for an unresponsive person.
Take the following steps when you witness anyone over
the age of one-year-old collapse:\n\n
1. Assess that it is safe to approach the fallen person.\n
2. Use protective equipment and follow universal
precautions. If you are able to, use common sense, and
stay away from any obvious hazards.\n
3. Attempt to wake the person by rubbing your knuckles
firmly against the sternum (breastbone) and shouting,
Are you okay?\n
    4. If the person fails to rouse, immediately call
    emergency number or shout for help, depending on
    your situation. If there is an AED available, also shout for
    someone to bring it.\n
    5. If the person becomes conscious, is moaning, or
    moves, do not start CPR.\n
    6. Call emergency number if the person is not able to
    speak or appears confused. If the person does not wake,
    begin CPR and use an AED if available.\n\n
    An AED is a small, portable electronic device that is used
    to deliver an electric shock in an attempt to disrupt or
    stop abnormal electrical activity in the heart. Abnormal
    electrical activity correlates with an abnormal heart
    rhythm, and a continual abnormal rhythm is not sufficient
    to pump blood and deliver oxygen through the body. An
    AED shock cannot restart a dead heart; the heart must
    have a rhythm (even though the rhythm is abnormal). The
    AED will automatically diagnose any cardiac arrhythmia
    when attached by leads to an unconscious person. When
    you see one of these lethal rhythms, you can then treat
    the person with the AED electrical therapy or a shock
    (defibrillation) that may interrupt the arrhythmia and allow
    the heart to re-establish a normal and effective rhythm.\n\n
Essential\n
The AHA recommends that rescuers push
hard, push fast (100 compressions per
minute), and allow complete chest recoil
between compressions, with minimal
interruptions in compressions, for all persons.\n\n
An AED is used to interrupt a lethal heart rhythm\n\n
The steps for performing CPR are:\n\n
1. Open the airway using the head-tilt, chin-lift method
one hand on the forehead, fingers of the other hand
under the bony part of the lower jaw, near the chin. Tilt
the head back, gently lift the jaw, making sure not to close
the mouth or push on soft parts beneath the chin. Avoid
lifting the neck in the case of spinal injury.\n
2. Check for normal breathing by putting your ear
to the
person' s mouth and turning your head to look for chest
movement, while listening for air flowing through the
mouth or nose and trying to detect breath on your cheek.
You sent
A person with periodic gasping is most likely in cardiac
arrest and needs CPR.\n
3. If there are no signs of breathing, pinch the nose;
make a seal over the mouth with yours and give the
person a breath strong enough for you to see the chest
rise. When the chest falls, repeat the rescue breath once
more for a total of two breaths. If available, use a CPR
mask as a barrier between your mouth and the person
mouth that you are rescuing. These first three steps are
called rescue breathing.\n
    4. Begin chest compressions by placing the heel of your
    hand in the middle of the chest, over the lower half of
    the breastbone at the nipple line. Place your other hand
    on top and lace your fingers together (heel of one hand
    on chest, heel of the other hand on top of that hand)
    and compress the chest about one to two inches. Allow
    the chest to recoil completely, and then perform thirty
    compressions, at a rate of 100 compressions per minute.\n
    5. After thirty chest compressions, immediately repeat
    the two rescue breaths. Open the airway with head tilt,
    chin-lift again. This time, go directly to rescue breaths
    without checking for breathing again. Give one breath,
    making sure the chest rises and falls, then give another.\n
    6. Perform the cycle of thirty compressions followed
    by two breaths for about two minutes. Then stop and
    recheck for breathing. If the person is not breathing,
    continue chest compressions and rescue breaths.\n

    Other Considerations\n
    The AHA now recommends that a series of
    thirty compressions followed by tvwo breaths
    (compressionventilation ratio of 30:2) be given to all
    persons, regardless of age. Continue the cycle of
    compressions and rescue breathing until professional
    help arrives or until the person recovers and begins
    breathing. In children age one to eight, use one or two
    hands as necessary to compress the chest one-third to
    one-half the depth of the chest. For the unresponsive
    infant or child, perform five cycles of thirty compressions
    and two breaths for about two minutes before leaving the
    child to call emergency number and get an AED if one is
    available.\n\n
    CPR for Newborns and Infants\n\n
    Newborn CPR has different recommendations than
    those for infants. But the recommendations for newborn
    CPR only apply to newborns in the first hours after birth
    until the newborn leaves the hospital, so the general
    public needs only to be concerned with infant CPR
    guidelines that apply to babies less than approximately
    one year of age. The rescue-breathing rate for infants
    with pulses is about forty to sixty breaths per minute,
    with chest compression to one-third the depth of the
    chest. Deliver ninety compressions and thirty ventilations
    per minute. Compress the infant chest just below the
    nipple line (on lower half of sternum) using two fingers
    (rather than a whole hand) to compress the chest witha
    compression-ventilation ratio of 30:2.\n\n
    Problems Associated with CPR\n\n
    Some of the problems the AHA has identified regarding
    performing CPR are excessive ventilation given during
    CPR and compressions that are interrupted too frequently
    and that are often too slow and too shallow. It s
    believed that bystanders may be reluctant to perform
    mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, the data illustrates that
    transmission of infection is very low: nonetheless, use
    of a barrier device (CPR mask) while giving ventilations
    is still encouraged. If you are still reluctant to give
    mouth-to-mouth ventilations, at least call for help and
    start chest compressions immediately.\n\n
    Alert!\n\n
    If you or a family member have a preexisting
    heart condition or are at high risk for heart
    failure, your doctor may be able to prescribe
    an AED that' s at least partially covered by
    your medical plan."/>
