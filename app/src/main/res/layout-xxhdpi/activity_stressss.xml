meet challenges, goals, and deadlines at work. Stress
pushes you to achieve so that you accomplish things that
result in feelings of satisfaction and happiness. But too
much stress has negative impacts, Such as exhaustion,
frustration, dissatisfaction, and even mental and physical
health problems, and eventually total burn out.\n\n
Unrealistic demands in a job and insufficient control
over job tasks and situations often lead to unhealthy
amounts of stress. Job uncertainty, such as fear of
layoff and increased demands for overtime, are also
typical negative stressors. Feeling pressured or having
little encouragement and praise at work can also lead
to stress, burnout, and decreased job satisfaction.
An accumulation of stressors has the potential to
create negative and unhealthy stress. Stressors can
result from factors such as degree of responsibility,
conflicting job demands, and working too much or too
little, which can lead to boredom. Pace and variety of
work, personal feelings about the meaningfulness of
work, level of autonomy, or the ability to make decisions
about your job and tasks are factors that may contribute
to stress. Environmental factors such as noise, light,
room temperature, and air quality may add to physical
problems as well as emotional stress. Shift work and
work hours that can lead to sleep deprivation are often
stressors that can lead to burnout.\n\n
Dealing with Workplace Stress\n\n
Workplace stresses and degree of stress have a lot of
variation, so strategies to reduce or prevent stress also
have to be multifaceted. Environmental stressors like
noise control, poor lighting, and ergonomics need to
addressed, but it' s up to you to report these stressors
to your boss or management. If you feel you have too
much responsibility and too little authority, are subject to
unfair labor practices, or have an inadequate, undefined
job description, you can address concerns by talking
with your supervisors first and then your union or other
organizations or grievance or personnel offices. Ask
to have your job description clarified, and don' t stay differently
The old expression, Find a job you love and you |Il
never Work another day in your life,
holds true. \n\nAnd
while it may not be possible to change jobs, you can
approach your supervisor with all of your concerns
and about providing stress-management training; and
you can take advantage of your employee-assistance
program (EAP) if available; this will improve your ability to
cope with difficult work situations. In order to keep stress
at bay, practice the following stress-reduction techniques
in your daily life:\n\n
1. Get an adequate amount of sleep (make sleep a
priority).\n
2. Develop a support system to share your feelings and
get validation and support.\n
3. Maintain a regular exercise program.\n
4. Eat a nutritious and balanced diet.\n
5. Reduce or eliminate caffeine and sugar.\n
6. Don't use alcohol or drugs to self-medicate.\n
    7. Set aside some Me
    time every day.\n\n
    Beyond Stress
    Burnout is a state of extreme emotional and physical
    exhaustion caused by prolonged and excessive stress
    over time. It may occur after feeling overwhelmed and
    unable to meet continual and constant demands. As the
    stressors continue, a person will begin to lose any interest
    or motivation that first brought them to pursue their job or
    take on their current role. Burnout reduces productivity
    radically, causes feelings of fatigue and apathy, and
    increasingly powerless, hopeless, cynical, and resentful.
    Burnout can eventually threaten your job, your health,
    and your relationships. You are usually aware of being
    under a lot of stress, but you may not always notice
    burnout when it happens. Burnout' s roots are in Burnout can eventually threaten your job, your health,

    under a lot of stress, but you may not always notice
    burnout when it happens. Burnout s roots are in
    excessive stress, and it sa gradual process, so learn to
    recognize symptoms and address them early on. Signs
    and symptoms of burnout include:\n\n
    •Feelings of frustration and powerlessness\n
    • Hopelessness\n
    • Being emotionally drained\n
    • Detachment, isolation, and withdrawal (both at work
    and at home)\n
    • Feeling trapped\n
    •Feelings of failure\n
    • Irritability\n
    • Sadness\n
    • Cynicism\n\n
    Many of the stress-prevention techniques outlined
    previously can also help prevent burnout. But the best
    way to head off job burnout is to change what you are
    doing, whether that means changing careers or jobs in
    your workplace. If neither of these is an option for you,
    there are still a number of steps you can take to recover
    from burnout, including talking to your employer about
    clarifying your job description. You may be unrealistically
    overextended or doing work you didn' t sign on for and
    are not getting paid for. Request a transfer to another
    department, or ask for new or more varied duties.\n\n
