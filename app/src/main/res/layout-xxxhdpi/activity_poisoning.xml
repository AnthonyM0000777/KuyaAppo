in contact with, or swallowing a harmful substance.
According to the CDC, about 2.5 million reported
poisonings occur in the United States every year. A
package without a warning label isn' tnecessarily safe.
Although symptoms of poisoning often take some time to
develop, if you think someone has been poisoned, don' t
wait for symptoms, but get that person medical help
immediately.\n\n
Many household items including medicines (for example
an aspirin overdose), household detergents and cleaning
products, carbon monoxide, some household plants,
paints, insecticides, chemicals, and even some foods can
poison if a person has inadvertent exposure. Depending
on the poison, symptoms will vary, but include:\n\n
• Abdominal pain\n
•Bluish lips\n
• Chest pain\n
• Confusion
Cough\n
• Diarrhea\n
• Difficuty breathing\n
Blurred vision\n
• Dizziness\n
• Drowsiness\n
• Fever\n
• Headache\n
• Heart palpitations\n
• Muscle twitching\n
• Nausea and vomiting\n
•Tingling and\n
• Numbness\n
•Seizures\n
• Skin rash and burns\n
• Stupor\n
• Loss of consciousness\n
• Unusual breath odor\n
• Weakness\n\n

First Aid for Poisoning\n\n
Take the following steps if you suspect poisoning:
1. Check for ABCS, call emergency number, begin rescue
breathing and CPR if necessary, and then call the Poison
Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for advice.\n\n
2. Try to identify the poison and do not make the person
throw up unless you are advised to do so by the Poison
Control Center (note that parents should not use syrup of
ipecac at home anymore).\n\n
3. If the person vomits on their own, take measures to
clear their airway, but wrapa cloth around your fingers
before sweeping out the mouth and throat.\n\n
4. If the person starts having a seizure, protect them
from injury by laying them down gently on a soft surface.
Do not restrain the person; instead, turn the head to one
side in order to keep the airway open.\n\n
5. Roll unconscious persons onto their left side in the
recovery position (go to Enmergency Response menu for
details) until help arrives.\n\n
6. Remove the person\n\n
s clothes if any poison has
spilled on them and flush the skin with water.\n\n
Essential\n\n
Call the Poison Cotrol Center for anyone
who becomes sick for no obvious reason, or
is found near a furnace, car, fire, or in an area
that is not well ventilated, because they need
to be evaluated for poisoning.\n\n
For inhalation poisoning call emergency number, and only
if it is safe, remove the person from the danger of the
gas, fumes, or smoke. Open all the windows and doors to
remove the fumes, while holding your breath or holding a
wet cloth over your nose and mouth.
