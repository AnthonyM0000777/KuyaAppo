            android:text="The recovery position is a technique used in first aid for
all unconscious people who are breathing. This includes
anyone over the age of one-year-old who has started
breathing after being given CPR, those who may be
unconscious or nearly unconscious but are still breathing,
those who are too inebriated to assure their continued
breathing, persons of near drowning, and in cases of
suspected poisoning.\n\n
An unconscious person who is lying face up is in a
position that may result in obstruction to the airway.
When a person is laying face up, the tongue may relax to
the back of the throat and fluids such as blood or vomit
can pool in the back of the throat and obstruct the airway.
Also, in the face-up position, the esophagus is tilting
down slightly from the stomach toward the throat, and
when combined with loss of musCular control that occurs
when someone is unconscious, this can lead to what is
called passive regurgitation-when the stomach contents
flow up into the throat. Aside from airway obstruction,
any fluid collecting in the back of the throat can floW
down into the lungs and the acid from the stomach that
is in that fluid can damage the lungs, a condition known
as aspiration pneumonia. In many instances, the actual
injury or illness that caused unconsciousness will not be
fatal, but the resulting passive regurgitation or aspiration
pneumonia will be.\n\n
A very common cause of death is excessive consumption
of alcohol that leads to unconsciousness followed by all
or some of these events. While in the recovery position,
the force of gravity keeps the tongue from obstructing the
airway and prevents fluids from flowing the wrong way.
This, coupled with raising the chest above the ground,
protects the person while aiding breathing.\n\n
Essential\n
You must suspect spinal injury and use
measures to stabilize the neck if the person
is unconscious because of an accidental fall,
collision, or any other traunma.\n\n
As in all first-aid situations, assess the area for safety
before approaching the unconscious person. Next,
assess the person for the ABCS. If there is no need to
performn CPR or if you already have performed CPR and
the person begins breathing, then put the person into
the recovery position. If there is no suspicion of spinal
or neck injury, you want to place the person into what is
called the lateral recovery position:\n\n
1. With the person lying on his back with legs straight
out, kneel on one side, facing him. Position the person' s
arm that is closest to you perpendicular to his body, with
his elbow flexed. Then position the other arm across the
body, resting the hand across the torso.\n
2. Bend the leg that is farthest from you up; the knee
elevated, reach behind the knee and pull the thigh toward
you.\n
3. Use your other arm to pul the shoulder farthest from
you while rolling the body toward you. Maintain the upper
leg in a flexed position so that the body is stabilized.\n\n
Because people who stay in this position for an extended
period of time may experience nerve compression,
you may move the person from side to side every thirty
minutes if emergency rescue is taking a long time to
arrive. In case of spinal injury, any other movement
of the unstabilized neck will carry a risk of causing
permanent paralysis or other injuries, so movement
should be minimized. \n\nThe only reason to move a person
with a suspected spinal injury intO a recovery position is
if you must drain vomit from the airway. And then you
should use what is called HAINES modified recovery
position (High Arm IN Endangered Spine). In this modified
position, raise one of the injured person
S arms above
the head (in full abduction) while turning the person' s
body in order to support the head and neck for less neck
movement.\n\n
In a suspected spinal or neck injury, your first priority is
keeping the airway open, so if the person is breathing,
leave them in the position you found them. But if
breathing stops, regardless of potential for increased
injury to the person, you must continue ABCS: airway,
breathing, and circulation. Breathing is the first priority;
everything else is second.\n\n
An unconscious pregnant woman should always be
positioned in the recovery position on her left side, and
anyone with wounds to the torso should be placed with
the wounds closest to the ground to decrease any chance
of blood pooling in the lungs.\n\n
Place a baby less than a year old in a modified recovery
position by holding the infant in your arms, head
tilted downward, in order to prevent the tongue from
obstructing the airway or the infant from inhaling vomit.
In all cases, continue to monitor the person s level of
response, pulse, and breathing until help arrives."/>
