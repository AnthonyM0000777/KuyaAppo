Occurs. Bleeding can be external, from a cut or wound,
or it can be internal, when the skin isn't broken but
blood vessels inside the body are damaged. There are
three different types of bleeding, depending on what kind
of vessel is damaged.\n\nArterial bleeding from damaged
arteries is bright red blood that gushes in a jet with each
heartbeat. Venous bleeding comes from damaged
veins and causes dark red blood loss that may not be as
severe but may bleed steadily. Capillary bleeding comes
from tiny blood vessels found throughout the body and
normally causes only slight blood loss. The seriousness
of any injury depends in part on how deep a cut is, how
much bleeding there is, how long it takes to control the
bleeding, and the type of blood vessels that are damaged.
In any bleeding injury, there is also a risk of infection,
particularly if the injury results in a foreign object stuck in
the wound.\n\n
Fact\n\n
The average-sized adult has a little less than
ten pints of blood and can safely lose a pint.
However, any rapid loss of blood in excess
of a pint will lead to a dangerous fall in blood
pressure, general weakness, confusion, and
sweating, also known as shock.\n\n
First Aid for Bleeding\n\n
Even though blood loss may not be severe, some people
do not handle the sight of blood wel, and this can cause
them to behave irrationally, faint, or even go into shock.\n\n
1. Try to keep the person as calm as possible, even if it
calls for mundane conversation.\n\n
2. Remember to monitor the person' s ABCS and have
him lie down and manage for shock if necessary (see
Chapter 2).\n\n
3. Apply direct pressure to most bleeding wounds,
except those that are caused by an object such as glass
or those that have protruding bone. For those types of
wounds, press down firmly on either side of the object,
keeping the injured body part above the level of the heart.\n\n
Controlling Severe Bleeding\n\n
Arterial bleeding may be life threatening and is often
difficult to control. The first and most effective method to
control bleeding is by applying direct pressure. To do this,
you should:\n\n
1. Place a sterile dressing or clean cloth over the injury
and secure it with tape, or tie something around the
wound just tight enough to control the bleeding.\n\n
2. If bleeding doesn' t stop, place another dressing
over the first or apply direct pressure over the wound as
outlined below.\n\n
3. Never remove a dressing once it has been applied to a
severe wound.\n\n
4. Elevate an injured arm, leg, or head above the level of
the heart to help control the bleeding.\n\n
5. Don' televate or move an area of the body if you
suspect a broken bone (fracture) until you have applied a
splint as outlined in Emergency Events and you are sure
that movement will cause no further injury.\n\n
When the use of direct pressure and elevation are not
controlling the bleeding, you can use indirect pressure
by applying pressure to the appropriate pressure point.
Pressure points are areas where you can control blood
flow by pressing the artery against an underlying bone
with your fingers, thumb, or heel of the hand. Use
pressure points with caution because you may cause
damage to an extremity due to inadequate blood floW
from the nearby pressure. Never apply pressure to the
neck (carotid) pressure points because it may reduce or
stop circulation to the brain, and can also cause cardiac
arrest.\n\n
The twO main pressure points mnost commonly used are
in the groin and upper arm. The femoral artery starts in
the lower abdomen and goes down into the thigh, and the
pressure point is the front, center part of the crease in the
groin that supplies the majority of blood to each leg. This
artery can be found by locating the pulse on the inner part
of the thigh and pressing it up against the pelvic bone.
The brachial artery is found on the upper, inside arm just
below the bicep, about halfvway between the shoulder
and elbow. Apply pressure to the inside of the arm over
the bone using your fingers or thumb. For any severe
bleeding of the thigh and lower leg, place the injured
person on her back, kneel on the side opposite the
wOunded leg, press the heel of your hand directly on the
femoral-artery point, and lean forward to apply pressure.
If the bleeding is still not controlled, use the flat surface of
your fingertips and press directly over the artery, applying
additional pressure on the fingertips using the heel of
your other hand.\n\n
Tourniquets may cause tissue damage and loss of
extremities and are only to be used when bleeding is
uncontrollable by other methods. You can use a strap,
belt, necktie, towel, or any piece of cloth folded to about
three or more inches wide and six to seven layers thick.
Never use anything that may cut into the skin such as
wire or cord.\n\n
The steps to apply a tourniquet are:\n\n
1. Position the tourniquet between the heart and the
wound while still maintaining the proper pressure point
and allowing two or more inches of unharmed skin
between the tourniquet."/>
