            android:text="Croup isa type of laryngitis in children, and is associated
with a seal-bark cough and difficulty inhaling air caused
by swelling of the voice box (larynx) and windpipe
(trachea). Croup is usually the result of a virus, but can
also be caused by allergies, bacteria, or inhaled irritants.
Croup is most common in children ages six months to
three years, although children can get croup at any age.
Croup is common during the months of October through
March. Most cases today are not serious, but severe
cases might require hospitalization.\n\n
Symptoms of croup are a very hoarse, deep, seal-bark
type cough appearing after several days of cold
symptoms that is usually worse at night. As croup
continues, a child may have labored breathing, a
high-pitched squawking or crowing noise on inhalation,
and a low fever. Croup is usually worst the first two or
three nights, resolving in a week or so. Vaccines for
measles, Haemophilus influenzae (Hib), and diphtheria
protect children against the more dangerous forms of
croup.\n\n
First Aid for Croup\n\n
Moist and cold air helps reduce the swelling of the
airways. This can be done at home in the following way:
1. Turn the hot water on in the shower or tub of a
bathroom and shut the door.\n\n
2. Once the bathroom is steamy, take your child into the
bathroom and sit with him for fifteen to twenty minutes
with the door closed.\n\n
3. You may also take your child, dressed warmly, out into
the cold night air.\n\n
Your child should sit straight up or stand to breathe more
easily. The steam treatment may help, but it doesn' t
cure the cough completely, so you may need to repeat
this routine throughout the night each time your child
wakes up coughing. You can also:\n\n
• Use a cool-mist humidifier in your child' s
room. (Humidifiers need to be cleaned daily with a bleachand-water solution to prevent the growth of mold
or bacteria.)\n\n
• Make sure your child is well hydrated with fluids.\n\n
• Give the appropriate dose of acetaminophen or
ibuprofen for fever. Never give your child aspirin, and
don' tgive cough medicine either; it won' thelp the
swelling in the throat, and it can make it more difficult to
cough up mucus.\n\n
If your child is not getting any relief with steam and cold
air, call your doctor for possible oral steroids to reduce
swelling and help her breathe more easily. Severe cases
of croup can lead to serious breathing difficulties, so call
your doctor for advice if you think your child has croup.
Labored breathing at rest, separate from a coughing
fit, may indicate a serious, potentially life-threatening
swelling in the throat. If your child is struggling for breath
and drooling, and her lips or skin are turning blue, call
emergency number immediately."/>
