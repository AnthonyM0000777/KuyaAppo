            android:text="Near drowning is defined as suffocation (severe oxygen
deprivation) from being submerged in water that does not
result in death. When death occurs, the incident is called
drowning. The following are symptoms of near drowning:\n\n
• Alert, but anxious to drowsy\n
• Person is not breathing or is gasping for breath,
coughing,\n
• or wheezing\n
• Vomiting\n
•Bluish color to the lips and ears (cyanosis)\n
• Pale appearance\n
• Cold skin\n\n
First Aid for Near Drowning\n\n
The following steps should be followed in the case of a
near drowning:\n\n
1. Rescue breathing as outlined in Emergency
Response menu must be started at once if the person is
unconscious, even while the person is still in the water, if
possible.\n\n
2. If you can, ask someone else to call emergency
number while you begin rescue breathing.\n\n
3. Get the person safely moved to land, lay him on his
back, and continue rescue breathing, beginning CPR if
necessary.\n\n
Water that may gush from their mouth comes from
the stomach, not the lungs, and requires that you turn
the person using a log roll so that the water can drain.
Vomiting can also occur.\n\n
Fact\n\n
Many people who experience near drowning
have happy outcomes. It s possible to
survive a forty-minute submersion with the
proper rescue and care, and many people
who receive CPR and intensive care recover fully.
Providing CPR and or rescue breathing immediately will
increase the chance of survival and lessen the chance
and extent of any brain damage, even if you believe
the person was under water for a very long time. Try to
stabilize and immobilize the neck to avoid adding to any
spinal injury. If the person is conscious, remove any wet
clothing, then wrap him in warm blankets and get him to a
hospital, regardless of how quickly you revive him or how
well he may feel.\n\n
The duration of submersion under water, water
temperature (cold-water accidents may have a better
S age (children have better
outcome), the person
outcomes than adults), and how sOon resuscitation
begins are factors that have the most influence on
a person s survival without permanent brain and
lung damage. A near drowning while drinking alcohol
increases a person' s chances of dying or developing
brain or lung damage."/>
