information from three generations of relatives that helps
doctors recognize the many factors that your family has
in common, including genes, environment, and lifestyle.
This medical history will give clues to medical conditions
that may run in your family, along with certain patterns
of disorders, to determine your risk of developing a
particular condition such as heart disease, high blood
pressure, stroke, certain cancers, and diabetes.\n\n
Compile an information record for al family members
that includes their full name, birth date, allergies, history
of illnesses, current and past medications, immunization
records, history of injuries, any disabilities, rehabilitations,
addiction and substance-abuse history and treatment,
past hospitalizations, and surgeries. Include any contact
information that a first responder may need in case of
disasters and in case of times where there may not be
anyone to provide the necessary information.\n\n
Make sure you also record the name and contact
information of your doctors, your insurance coverage,
who to notify in case of emergency, and even your
religious preference in your medical-information record."/>
