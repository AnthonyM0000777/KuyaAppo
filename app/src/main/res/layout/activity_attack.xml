            android:text="Sometimes heart attacks are sudden and there is no
doubt what is happening, but those are the minority. Most
heart attacks begin slowly with very mild discomfort and
pain. The biggest mistake is when people aren' t sure
and they wait too long to seek help. If you or anyone
you know has the following symptoms, seek help
immediately:\n\n
• Chest discomfort such as uncomfortable pressure,
squeezing, fullness, or pain in the center of the chest
lasting more than a few minutes, or that comes and goes.\n
• Discomfort in other areas of the upper body including
pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck,
jaw, or stomach.\n
• Shortness of breath\n
•A cold sweat, nausea, or light headedness\n\n
Women are more likely to have some of the other
common symptoms, in particular back or jaw pain,
shortness of breath, nausea, and vomiting. Even if you
are not sure, it s wise to call emergency number. If
you are not able to access Emergency Medical Services
(EMS), have somneone else drive you to the hospital
immediately. Never drive yourself unless there is no other
option.\n\n
Question?\n\n
Are the symptoms of a heart attack the same
for both men and women?
Women have the same symptoms as men
but, are more prone to also have back or
jaw pain, shortness of breath, nausea, and
vomiting. You need to seek immediate
medical help for any symptoms, not just the
classic symptoms of a heart attack.\n\n
What Is Happening?\n\n
The heart functions both mechanically and electrically.
It pumps blood by contracting, which you are able to
feel as a pulse-the mechanical function. The heart
also has cells that regulate the mechanical system
by transmitting electrical signals through conduction
pathways, stimulating the muscle tissue to contract-the
electrical function. The rate of electrical stimulation or
pulses normally correlates with the rate of heart-muscle
contractions or beats, and should be between sixty and
eighty times per minute at rest, increasing with exertion.
The pumping chambers of the heart are the ventricles.\n\n
If they suddenly stop effectively contracting and pumping
blood into the body, Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA)
occurs. The heart then has a disorganized and abnormal
rhythm and spasmodic twitching called ventricular
    fibrillation (VE) that is ineffective in pumping blood to
the body. The person in VF or V fib usually has no pulse
because the heart is not pumping blood, and they will
then become unresponsive, stop breathing, and die within
minutes without intervention.
