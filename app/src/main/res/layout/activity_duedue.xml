broken because cuts provide an opportunity for infection
causing bacteria, viruses, and fungi to enter the body.\n\n
Infections may develop only in one place on the body
(localized infection) or circulate throughout the body
via the bloodstream (systemic infection). Synmptoms of
localized infection include skin that is warm or hot, pain in
the area, a pus-like discharge, redness and swelling, and
fever and chills. Most minor, localized infections can be
cared for at home taking the following steps:\n\n
1. Wash the area daily with soap and water.\n\n
2. Apply antibiotic ointment or cream and cover the
infected area lightly with a dry gauze, nonstick bandage.\n\n
3. Watch for signs of a mnore serious infection such as
increased redness, pain, swelling, or pus.\n\n
A localized infection may develop into a serious local
infection called cellulitis, when the skin around the
wound becomes raised, red, painful, and thickens in
texture with symptoms including swollen lymph nodes,
red streaks on the skin, fever, chills, and shaking. A
local infection may also turn into a systemic infection
with symptoms including fever, shaking, chills, overall
weakness, and joint aches. See your medical provider if
you have a localized infection that does not begin to clear
in three days; for any symptoms of cellulitis or systemic
infection; for any infections of the face, particularly near
the eyes; for infections in young children and the elderly:\n\n
or for anyone with an underlying medical condition. To
infection, wash hands frequently, don' tpick or scratch
sores or blemishes, wash all cuts or scratches with soap
and water, and keep injuries clean and bandaged."/>
