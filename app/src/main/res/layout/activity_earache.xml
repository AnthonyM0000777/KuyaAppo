            android:text="The most common causes of earaches are an infection
of the middle ear (otitis media) and an inflammation
of the outer ear canal (otitis externa), also called
swimmer s ear. Causes include a minor injury to the
ear canal, fluid trapped in the inner ear, or bacteria that
leads to discomfort, swelling, and pain. Earaches are not
contagious, and usually result from a complication to a
cold and are sometimes associated with bottle feeding,
pacifier use, secondhand smoke, and allergies.
Symptoms of an earache include severe stabbing pain,
hearing loss, itching, fever, nausea or vomiting, swelling
of the ear, ringing or buzzing sounds, and fluids draining
from the ear.\n\n
First Aid for Earache\n\n
In the case of a high fever or discharge from the ear
canal, get immediate medical attention, as antibiotics
are necessary if the cause of the earache is an infection.
Take the following steps:\n\n
• Children should always be seen by a doctor.\n\n
• Take the entire course of any prescribed antibiotics.\n\n
• Use OTC painkillers such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen,
and aspirin (adults only), eardrops, and hot packs to help
alleviate pain.\n\n
• To help prevent ear infections, wash hands often.\n\n
• Use a bulb syringe to suction mucus gently out of the
nose of infants and toddlers and keep baby' s head tilted
up during feeding.\n\n
• Elevate the head of a child' s bed a few inches (place
item under the mattress, not on top where it could lead to
suffocation) to help drain the fluid that collects behind the
eardrums and use a humidifier in your child' s room at
night.\n\n
Never place cotton-tipped swabs, matches, hairpins, or
anything else in the ear. This can push wax further into
the ear canal or perforate the eardrum, resulting in severe
ear damage.\n\n
Treating an Ear Injury\n\n
Ear injuries are typically accompanied by pain, dizziness,
hearing loss, and bleeding from inside the ear canal. Take
the following steps to treat an ear injury:\n\n
1. Cover the outside of the ear loosely with a bandage
or dressing to soak up blood and drainage, but do not
attempt to plug the ear or try to stop any flow.\n\n
2. Place the person on the injured side with the injured
ear facing down to drain the blood, and call emergency
number or go to an emergency department immediately."/>
