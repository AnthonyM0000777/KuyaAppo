            android:text="Preventing and managing shock is a matter of life and
death in emergencies. When the circulatory system stops
working to deliver blood to the body, shock occurs. If
the heart beats irregularly, if blood vessels become too
dilated, or if a person is losing too much blood, shock
may occur. The symptoms of shock are a weak and
rapid pulse; disorientation; dizziness or confusion; cold,
clammy skin and hands and pale skin; extreme thirst;
nausea and vomiting: high level of anxiety: and fingernails
that do not blanch with applied pressure (turn white when
pressed and color does not return within two seconds).\n\n
If someone is in shock, elevate her legs, keep her warm, and turn
her head
to one side if neck injury is not suspected
In emergency situations you must guard the person
against shock. Call emergency number for help
immediately, because you cannot manage shock alone
for long, and the person is likely to go into cardiac arrest.
Check the ABCS continually while waiting for help and
begin CPR if needed. If the head, neck, back, hips, or
legs are not injured, lay the person on the ground facing
up and elevate the legs to keep critical blood flow to
vital organs. Use a towel, a sanitary napkin, or a piece
of clothing to apply pressure to open wounds to slow
bleeding. Keep the person calm, comfortable, and warm,
but never give the person water, even if they claim to be
very thirsty. Monitor the person for consciousness and
ABCS continually until help arrives."/>
